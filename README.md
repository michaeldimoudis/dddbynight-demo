# DDD by Night demo app, Melbourne July 15 2016
Completed demo app from my DDD by Night talk on Intro to Xamarin Forms
- MVVM
- Custom renderers
- Native embedded controls

Thanks to Xamarin forums, and the native embedded controls samples from James Montemagno https://blog.xamarin.com/embedding-native-controls-into-xamarin-forms/ and Diego Varela for https://github.com/diego-varela/XamarinXamlEmbeddedNativeControl to get native embedded controls working in a PCL.
